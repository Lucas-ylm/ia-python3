certs in cities around the world to focus attention on such natural environmental hazards as: ● drought Ready to begin? ● flooding ● wind and dust st orms ● hurricanes ● lightning ● and, on a lighter note, wonderful daily weather.3 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER DAILY WEATHER What causes the weather?“What ’s the weather going to be?” Isn’t this one of the most often-asked questions?Think of all the ways in which weather affects your daily activities.For most of us, all we want to know is, “Will it be hot or cold, wet or dry?” If you listen to television or radio weather reports, that ’s what you hear.Will you be able to get in your soc­ cer game or practice?Will school be closed by a heavy snowfall?Is it a good day to go swimming?These and many other things that you do depend on the weather.So what do we mean by “weather ”?How do we meas­ ure and predict weather?Is weather the same in the tropics as in the mid-latitudes, where most of this coun- try’s population lives?
These are some of the questions you’ll have to answer in selecting the cities for your tour. You may already know that here in the mid-latitudes, most of our weather results from the collision of differ­ ing air masses.Most of our storms form where warmer and cooler air masses collide.Such a boundary is called a warm front if warmer air is displacing cooler air, a cold front if cooler air is displacing warmer air, a sta­ tionary front if the differing air masses are not moving, and a complex (occluded) front if the differing air masses have become mixed with each other.Anticyclones (high-pressure systems) generally bring us fair weather while cyclones (low-pressure systems) are associated with stormy weather.The National Weather Service (NWS) —at http://www .nws.noaa.gov —is the government agency responsible for collecting official weather observations and issuing predictions.
The NWS operates an extensive network of instruments stationed at airports and other land loca­tions, on buoys in lakes and at sea, and carried upward by weather balloons, as well as Doppler radar and weather satellites. Most television, radio, and newspaper weather information originates from the NWS, even though many media outlets have their own meteorolo­ gists on staff.Action Item DW1 For you to begin your research, you must first learn how to find, interpret, and describe weather data.To begin, find the current weath­ er for your location (or a nearby location).Record the information below, being sure to include the source of your information.What does this information tell you?What images are provided?Do they help you to inter­ pret the data?Why or why not?Describe what you see.Provide references.
WEATHER VARIABLE CURRENT VALUE SOURCE OF INFORMATION/IMAGES Temperature Air pressure Wind direction Wind speed Sky cover Relative humidity Precipitation Other conditions Action Item DW2 Select some locations around the world where you might schedule your “Global Awareness Tour ” and describe the present weather in those areas. (As a guide to what to look for, use the weather variable list from Action Item DW1.) Write this information on a “post-it ” note or index card, then place it on the world map with a push pin or flag.What is the source of your information?What did you find out?Why did you select these locations?4 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER DAILY WEATHER—EXTREME WEATHER Now it’s time to choose some potential sites for your “Global Awareness Tour.” For the start of the concert tour, you might want to choose locations that have great weather.
Action Item DW3 Using the knowledge you have gained in your research and information from the NASA TRMM satellite, identify three possible locations that would have the fine weather conditions you ’d like for your concert. Be sure to provide supporting informa­ tion for your selection.LOCATION REASON IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE TOUR EXTENSION ACTIVITIES 3.“Think about ….” 1.Learn more about how satellites detect processes What is one question that you thought of during and events on our planet using http://www .noaa.this part of your “Global Awareness Tour ” study that gov/satellites.html.Compare and contrast polar-you might wish to investigate further?What re- orbiting and geostationary satellites.sources do you need to carry out your investigation?2.Compare TRMM data with TOPEX/Poseidon or JASON sea surface observations: http://topex-www .jpl.nasa.gov EXTREME WEATHER “That ’s too much!” Has anyone ever said that to you?Or have you ever said that to someone else?
When it comes to weather, how much is “too much? ” What hap­ pens when there ’s too much or too little rain or snow, very strong winds, or severe conditions?How can TRMM be used to study such extreme weather events?Remember that one of the main purposes of the “Global Awareness Tour ” is to focus attention on how severe weather can have an impact on people.So this is your opportunity to find locations that will demon­strate fascinating aspects of our global environment.Action item EW1 In tr ying to learn as much as you can about world weather patterns, a local meteor­ ologist has provided you with some limited guidance.You have been told that data obtained from the TRMM satellite will be very helpful for your research.However, this is all you ’ve been told.You ’ll need to learn more about this satellite, the type of information it provides, and why it is especially useful to you.The only guidance you’ve received on this satellite is its name.
Where do you go to get information on the satellite? What have you found?Why is this satellite different from others?Remember, you were selected to organize this concert because of your reputation for detail.Computers have been able to put together millions of TRMM observations into one map that shows precipita­ tion over the first five-year period of this satellite ’s oper­ ation.Make sure you include this map in your research: http://trmm.gsfc .nasa.gov/images/5-year_TRMM_ climo.gif 5 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER EXTREME WEATHER Often, extreme weather events in distant parts of the world are related to each other.TRMM can help identify these connections.For example, did you know that flooding in South America and drought in Indonesia and Northern Australia almost always occur when there is an El Ni ño?You can read more about these connec­ tions at: http://trmm.gsfc .nasa.gov/overview_dir/ variability_el_nino.html Drought can occur for several reasons.
In some places, global climatic conditions cause permanent drought. One such example would be over the Sahara Desert in North Africa.Do the TRMM climatology images show this?Where else would you find such long-term drought conditions?In other locations, droughts may exist for shorter periods.What parts of the world are experiencing drought now?What might be causing these conditions?Other important connections you might want to know about, so you can help others know more through the “Global Awareness Tour, ” are the well-established ones between extreme weather and certain diseases: http:// trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/overview_dir/climate_disease.html Action Item EW2 Use your TRMM satellite research and other sources to identify parts of the world that now or in the recent past have experienced: ● FLOODING ● DROUGHT S Then, use the chart on this page to list your location selection for each of the listed categories, the reasons you selected those locations, and your supporting references.

Use TRMM resources to answer this question. Action Item EW7 Use the information you gath­ ered for the chart on p.8 to identify one location in the United States and one location elsewhere in the world where hurricanes or typhoons are taking place now.Be HURRIC ANES/TYPHOONS U.S.LOCATION SOURCE WORLD LOCATION SOURCE sure to include the source of your data.If no storm is taking place now, you can go into the archives to make these selections.On another sheet of paper, write a summary of your observations and conclusions, using the knowledge you have gained from your research.EXTENSION ACTIVITIES 1.Examine current TRMM images to determine whether there are any active storms in tropical waters.Are there any at this time?(Be sure to check both hemispheres and all oceans.) If so, are they still tropical cyclones or tropical storms, or have they grown into hurricanes?2.Look at some of the archived TRMM images and movies from previous hurricanes.
Describe some of these that you find most interesting. There are many other Web sites where you can learn more about hurricanes and typhoons.The Tropical Prediction Center (formerly the National Hurricane Center) —http://www .nhc.noaa.gov —is our country ’s official forecast and research authority on these powerful storms.They provide useful information about current and past storms.Another Web site for interesting information is the USA Today Weather Page: http://www .usatoday.com/ weather.They offer brief, but understandable descrip­ tions about these storms, excellent graphics, and an easy- to-use archive.3.What are two questions about hurricanes or typhoons that you might wish to investigate further, based on the images and other data available in the TRMM and other Web pages you have used?4.Find out how likely it is that the area in which you live will be affected by a hurricane or typhoon.
Design a plan for your school, community, and family to handle the approach of a hurricane. 9 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER EXTREME WEATHER TRMM also carries a Lightning Image S ensor (LIS).This instrument is the first satellite-borne system to observe the global extent of lightning strikes in the tropics.The data obtained by LIS provide important new informa­tion about the electrodynamic nature of our planet, connections between lightning and precipitation, and many other discoveries.Lightning is one of the most dangerous weather phenomena in the U.S.and around the world, killing hundreds and injuring thousands each year.So the more we know, the better we can design protection techniques.At its simplest level, lightning is caused by the buildup of an electrical charge in large, vertically developing clouds.A cloud can build up an electrical charge through the rising and falling of air currents.
Raindrops, hailstones, and ice pellets collide with smaller water LIGHTNING U.S. LOCATION SOURCE WORLD LOCATION SOURCE droplets and ice in updrafts and downdrafts.Falling streams create a negative charge that accumulates in the lower parts of clouds, while rising streams create positive charges that accumulate in the upper parts.A lightning discharge neutralizes these differences.Action Item EW8 Use the information you gath­ ered for the chart on p.8 to identify one location in the United States and one location elsewhere in the world where lightning is taking place now.Be sure to include the source of your data.If no storm is taking place now, you can go into the archives to make these selections.On another sheet of paper, write a summary of your observations and conclusions, using the knowledge you have gained from your research.EXTENSION ACTIVITIES 1.Examine TRMM lightning images carefully.Answer the following questions: ● What par ts of the world get a lot of lightning?
● What par ts get none or very little lightning? ● Are there any parts of the world where it surprises you to see that lightning commonly occurs or doesn ’t occur?● Do all locations along any given latitude experi­ ence the same amount of lightning?Along any given longitude?2.Try these two simple experiments to demonstrate how electrical charges can build up: ● Take two balloons.First, just bring them together.What happens?Then rub them briefly.What hap­ pens now when they are brought together?Explain.● With wat er running in a sink in a small thin stream, run a comb through your hair several times and place the comb near the water.Describe and explain what happens.3.Where can you learn more about the dangers of lightning and what to do about it?The National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) leads our efforts in lightning research.
You can find more interesting information about light­ning and thunderstorms at: http://www .nssl.noaa.gov/edu/ltg http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/resources http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/researchitems/ thunderstorms.shtml http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/hazard 4. How would it feel to be struck by lightning?You can read some survivor stories at: http://www .science.nasa.gov/newhome/ headlines/essd18jun99_1.htm 10 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER EXTREME WEATHER THUNDER MATH EXTENSION ACTIVITY You probably already know that you see lightning before you hear its thunder because light travels faster than sound.You may also know that you can tell how far away you are from the lightning by using a simple “rule of thumb ”: If you count how many seconds it takes to hear thunder after you see a lightning stroke, every five seconds equals a distance of one mile (or 1.6 kilometers).
So, for example, if you see lightning and then count ten seconds before you hear the thun­ der, then the lightning was two miles (3.2 kilometers) away (ten divided by five.) Here ’s a simple math activi­ ty to understand more about this: During a storm, six students at locations A, B, C, D, E, and F saw the lightning stroke at point L at the same moment. The scale on this map is: one centimeter equals one mile.As mentioned above, every five-sec-ond difference between when you see lightning and when you hear thunder means a distance of one mile (or 1.6 kilometers) between you and the storm.Use this information to answer the following questions.A ● C ● SCALE: 1 centimeter = 1 mile (or 1.6 kilometers) 1.Which student heard the thunder first?_______ How long after seeing the lightning?____________ seconds.2.Which student heard the thunder last?_______ How long after seeing the lightning?____________ seconds.3.Which two students heard the thunder at the same time?_______ and _______ .4.
How far away from the storm was student B? ____________ miles.5.If the storm moved to directly above where student E is and another lightning stroke occurred, how long would it take before student C heard it?____________ seconds.E ● L F ● ● D ● B 0 1 2 3 4 Centimeters 11 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER THIS IS IT!“ ” It is now time to make your final decision.In the table below, summarize your choices for locations in your Global Awareness Tour.Then plot these on your world map with push pins or flags.Student Work Sheet TYPE OF EVENT 2 POSSIBLE LOCATIONS TRMM /OTHER DATA THAT HELPED YOU LOCATE THEM WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THESE SITES?Fine weather Flooding Drought Wind or dust storm Hurricane or typhoon Lightning EXTENSION ACTIVITY: What songs w ould your favorite group perform at each location?Why?12 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER APPENDIX A Bibliography/Resources Bohr en, Craig F.1987.Clouds in a Glass of Beer : Simple Experiments in Atmospheric Physics.

Students become active and responsible for their own learning, and the activity is student-centered; the teacher becomes more of a facilitator or guide, monitoring student progress. By using this model, the students gain information through a series of self-directed activities in which the students need to solve a problem.These problems drive the learning process and are designed to help students develop the skills necessary for critical think­ ing and problem solving.Students learn that in the real world, problems, and their solutions, are not always cut and dried, and that there may be different possible answers to the same problem.They also learn that as they continue to gain information, they need to readjust their plan.In other words, they must per­form self-assessment.A PBL lesson starts with a problem posed directly to the students.These problems are poorly structured to reflect real-world situations.
Students (most commonly in small, cooperative groups) are then left to deter­mine what steps need to be taken in order to solve the problem. The teacher does not give the students the information needed prior to the activity.However, the teacher does need to make sure the students have enough prior knowledge to be able to interpret the problem and determine a plan of action.A key component of PBL is constant feedback.While the students are constantly assessing their work, and in turn adjusting their plan, teachers also need to pro­ vide continual, immediate feedback.Without feedback, students may be uncomfortable with this type of activity, because they do not know what is expected of them.Teacher feedback provides reinforcement for student learning.Feedback should be an authentic, performance-based assessment.Students need to continually evaluate their contributions.
Rubrics pro­vide a good guide for both teachers and students, to ensure that the students are continually kept on the right track. Why use PBL?Traditional teaching methods focus on providing students with information and knowledge.The PBL model also adds “real-world ” problem-solving skills to the classroom.It teaches students that there is some­ times more than one possible answer, and that they have to learn how to decide between/among these answers.Students and PBL Students ar e broken up into groups and are pre­ sented with a poorly structured, complex problem.Students should have enough background knowledge to understand the problem, but should not be experts.Any one, specific solution to the problem should not be evident.The students will need to determine what the problem is that they need to solve.Some organiza­tional questions they may ask themselves are: ● What do w e know about this problem?● What do w e need to know?
● How/where do we get the information needed to solve the problem? The next step for the students is to determine a problem statement.From the information given to them in the problem, they should determine what they need to know and then plan a course of action to get the information they need to propose a solution.In implementing this plan, they will have to gather information to help them solve the problem.They will need to be sure that the resources they use are cur­rent, credible, accurate, and unbiased.As information is gathered and interpreted, they then apply their new knowledge, reevaluate what they know, and redeter­mine what they need to know to solve the problem.Once all the information is gathered, interpreted, and discussed, the group works together to propose a final solution.18 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER Appendix D: Problem-Based Learning Benefits of PBL By using the P roblem-Based Learning method, stu­ dents gain more than just knowledge of facts.
They develop critical thinking skills while working in collab­ orative groups to try to solve a problem. In doing this, they learn how to: ● interpret the question/problem, ● develop a problem statement, ● conduct research, reevaluating prior knowledge as new knowledge is gained, ● determine possible solutions, and ● pick the best possible solution based on the inf or­ mation they have gathered.By providing immediate student feedback, the stu­ dents can continually readjust their thinking, correct­ ing any misconceptions or errors before moving on.By using PBL, students become more familiar with “real-world ” problems.They learn that there is not always only one correct answer, and that they need to work together to gather enough information to deter­mine the best solution.The PBL Classroom When using the PBL model of instruc tion, it is best for students to work in small cooperative groups.
The objective of this model is for students to work in a col­ laborative setting where they can learn social and eth­ical skills to determine how to answer the question presented. Students are expected to regulate them­ selves while in these working groups.PBL Assessment As the student groups work together to collect infor­ mation, they will need to constantly assess their own progress and readjust their plan.As they do this, they will need continual, immediate feedback from the teacher.When they become more comfortable with this model, they will learn to rely less on the teacher and become more independent.By providing the stu­dents with the grading rubric, it will serve as a guide to ensure they are on the right track throughout the activity.
19 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER APPENDIX E TRMM Introduction/Instr uments Introduction to the T ropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Rainfall is one of the most important weather and climate variables that determine whether mankind survives, thrives, or perishes. Water is so ubiquitous on planet Earth that we often take it for granted.Too much water results in devastating floods, and the famine caused by too little water (drought) is repsonsible for more human deaths than all other nat­ural disasters combined.Water comprises more than 75 percent of our bodies and as much as 95 percent of some of the foods we eat.Water is essential to life, as it nourishes our cells and removes the waste they generate.Water determines whether plants produce food, or whether they wither from drought or rot from dampness.Water is essential to our homes and factories, to our production of food, fiber, and manufactured goods, and to just about everything else we produce and consume.
Although water covers more than 70 percent of the Earth ’s sur­ face, only about 3 percent is fresh water —and about 75 percent of that is inaccessible because it is locked up in glaciers and icecaps. Another important aspect of rainfall, or any other precipitation, is its role in redistributing the energy the Earth receives from the Sun.Evaporation of water from the Earth ’s surface, condensation of water vapor into cloud droplets or ice particles, precipitation, runoff of the precipitation, and melting of snow and ice consti­ tute what is known as the water cycle, or the hydrolog­ical cycle.Evaporation, the process of changing water from liquid to gas form, absorbs 540 calories of energy per gram of water; while simply raising the tempera­ ture of a gram of water one degree Celsius —without changing its phase — requires only one calorie of energy.
Thus, much of the Sun ’s energy that reaches the Earth ’s surface is used to evaporate water instead of raising the temperature of the surface. The resulting water vapor is carried upward by the atmosphere until it reaches a level where it is cooled to its condensation temperature.Then the water vapor releases the energy (540 calories per gram) it absorbed during the evapo­ ration process.This “latent heat ” release can occur thousands of kilometers from where the latent heat was originally absorbed.Water plays an additional critical role in weather and climate: water vapor, it turns out, is the most abundant and most important greenhouse gas!Greenhouse gases trap some of the energy given off by the Earth ’s surface in the atmosphere.Therefore, the distribution and quantity of water vapor in the atmosphere are important in determining how well the Earth can emit the energy it absorbs from the Sun back into space.Unless the Earth loses as much energy as it receives, it will warm up.
If the Earth loses more energy than it receives, it will cool down. The distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere also affects cloudiness; and clouds play an important role in determining how much solar energy reaches the Earth ’s surface, as well as how much heat can escape to space.Perhaps it is now obvious that water, in all its forms, plays a critical role in determining what we call weath­ er and climate.Our understanding of the complicated interactions involving water is insufficient to permit us to forecast, with much skill, weather beyond several days and climate beyond a few months.Because the occurrence of precipitation is highly variable in both time and space, and almost three-fourths of the Earth ’s surface has no rain gauges because it is covered by the oceans, we have never been able to adequately observe the global distribution of rain.Measurements from rain gauges on islands and satellite images of clouds have led to estimates of global precipitation.
But TRMM—the first satellite to measure precipitation with the accuracy available from a radar in combina­ tion with other remote sensors —represents a break­ through in our ability to monitor precipitation on a global scale. This is already leading to improved fore­casts, as shown on the next page.20 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER Appendix E: TRMM Introduction/Instr uments without TRMM with TRMM Actual Storm Track Hurricane B onnie, August 1998: 5-Day Forecasts vs.Actual Storm Track Impro ved forecasts can save money ($600K –$1M per mile of coast evacuated) and lives by more precisely predicting where the hurricane eye will be located at landfall.Source: Dr.A.Hou, NASA DAO TRMM Instruments TRMM M icrowave Imager (TMI) The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is a passive microwave sensor that detects and images microwave radiation emitted by water droplets, ice particles, and the Earth ’s surface.
TMI detects radiation at five differ­ ent frequencies, which helps to distinguish between rainfall, bodies of water, and land. Data obtained from this instrument is used to quantify the water vapor, cloud water, and rainfall intensity in the atmosphere.Precipitation Radar (PR) The Precipitation Radar (PR), an active sensor, is the first space-based precipitation radar.PR emits radar pulses toward Earth, which are then reflected by pre­ cipitation particles back to the radar.By measuring the strength of the returned pulses, the radar is able to estimate rainfall rates.Among the three main instru­ ments on TRMM, PR is the most innovative.Other instruments similar to TMI and the Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) have operated in space before, but PR is the first radar launched into space for the purpose of measuring rainfall.
Data obtained from this instrument: ● provides three-dimensional storm structures; ● helps t o determine the intensity and three-dimen- sional distribution of rainfall over land and water, which can be used to infer the three-dimensional distribution of latent heat in the atmosphere; ● provides information on storm depth; and ● provides information on the height at which falling snow or ice particles melt into rain. Visible Infrared Scanner (VIRS) The Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) measures radi­ance in five wavelength bands (from visible to infrared) emitted by clouds, water vapor, and the Earth ’s surface.The intensity of radiation from a cloud corresponds with the brightness or temperature of the cloud, which in turn indicates the height of the cloud —brighter (colder) clouds are higher in altitude, and darker (warmer) clouds are lower.In general, high­er clouds are associated with heavier rain.
By compar­ ing VIRS observations with rainfall estimates from TMI and PR, scientists are able to better understand the relationship between cloud height and rainfall rate, and can apply this knowledge to radiation measure­ ments made by other weather satellites. Cloud and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) The Clouds and the Earth ’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) measures the amount of energy rising from the Earth ’s surface, atmosphere, and clouds.Clouds can have both a warming and cooling effect on the Earth, trapping energy emitted by the Earth ’s surface while blocking energy from the Sun.Similarly, water vapor also warms the Earth by trapping outgoing radiation, but also condenses to form clouds that sometimes have a cooling effect.Data from this instrument helps scientists learn more about how the Earth distributes the energy it receives from the Sun, as well as the effects of clouds and water vapor on the overall tem­ perature and energy budget of the Earth.
This informa­ tion will help long-term climate models make more accurate predictions. Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) The Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) is a powerful instrument that can detect and locate cloud-to- ground, cloud-to-cloud, and intra-cloud lightning.The information gained from this instrument is used to classify cloud types and, together with other TRMM instruments, to correlate lightning flash rate with storm properties, including rainfall rate.It ’s also expect­ ed that the information provided from LIS will lead to future advances in lightning detection and forecasting.21 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER APPENDIX G Glossar y active TRMM sensors— A remote-sensing system that transmits its own radiation to detect an object or area for observation and receives the reflected or transmitted radiation.Radar is an example of an active system.1 The TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) is an active sensor.
2 air masses —Large bodies of air, often hundreds or thousands of miles across, containing air of a similar temperature and humidity. Sometimes the differ­ ence between air masses are hardly noticeable, but if colliding air masses have very different tempera­ tures and humidity values, storms can erupt.1 anticyclone (high pressure system) —A high pressure area where winds blow clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the southern hemisphere.1 cold front —The leading edge of an advancing cold air mass that runs under and displaces the warmer air in its path.Generally, with the passage of a cold front, the temperature and humidity decrease, the pressure rises, and the wind shifts (usually from the southwest to the northwest in the northern hemi­ sphere).Precipitation is generally at and/or behind the front, and with a fast-moving system, a squall line may develop ahead of the front.
3 complex (occluded) front —A composite of two fronts formed as a cold front overtakes a warm front. A cold occlusion results when the coldest air is behind the cold front.The cold front undercuts the warm front and, at the Earth ’s surface, coldest air replaces less-cold air.1 cyclones (low pressure systems) —An area of low pressure where winds blow counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere.1 Doppler radar —A radar that determines the velocity of falling precipitation either toward or away from the radar unit by taking into account the Doppler shift (The change in wave frequency that occurs when the emitter or the observer is moving toward or away from the other).
4 GOES satellite (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) —NASA-developed, NOAA-operated series of satellites that: • provide continuous day and night weather observations; • monitor severe weather events such as hurricanes, thunderstorms, and flash floods; • relay environmental data from surface collecting platforms to a processing center; • perform facsimile transmissions of processed weather data to low-cost receiving stations; • monitor the Earth ’s magnetic field, the energetic particle flux in the satellite ’s vicinity, and x-ray emissions from the Sun; • detect distress signals from downed aircraft and ships. 1 See also: http://www .oso.noaa.gov/goes and http://rsd .gsfc.nasa.gov/goes latitude/longitude —Latitude (aka geodetic latitude) is the angle between a perpendicular at a location, and the equitorial plane of the Earth.Longitude is the angular distance from the Greenwich meridian (0°), along the equator.
This can be measured either east or west to the 180th meridian (180 °) or 0 ° to 360° W. 1 passive TRMM sensors— A system, or instrument, that uses only radiation emitted by the object being viewed, or reflected by the object from a source other than the system or instrument.1 The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI), Visible Infrared Radiometer (VIR), Cloud and Earth Radiant Energy Sensor (CERES), and Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) are all passive sensors.2 radar— Acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging.An electronic instrument used to detect distant objects and measure their range by how they scat­ ter or reflect radio energy.Precipitation and clouds are detected by measuring the strength of the elec­ tromagnetic signal reflected back.3 stationary front —A front which is nearly stationary or moves very little.May be known as a quasi-stationary front.3 22 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER Appendix G: Glossar y TRMM instrumen ts —See Appendix E.

These are some of the questions you’ll have to answer in selecting the cities for your tour. You may already know that here in the mid-latitudes, most of our weather results from the collision of differ­ ing air masses.Most of our storms form where warmer and cooler air masses collide.Such a boundary is called a warm front if warmer air is displacing cooler air, a cold front if cooler air is displacing warmer air, a sta­ tionary front if the differing air masses are not moving, and a complex (occluded) front if the differing air masses have become mixed with each other.Anticyclones (high-pressure systems) generally bring us fair weather while cyclones (low-pressure systems) are associated with stormy weather.The National Weather Service (NWS) —at http://www .nws.noaa.gov —is the government agency responsible for collecting official weather observations and issuing predictions.
The NWS operates an extensive network of instruments stationed at airports and other land loca­tions, on buoys in lakes and at sea, and carried upward by weather balloons, as well as Doppler radar and weather satellites. Most television, radio, and newspaper weather information originates from the NWS, even though many media outlets have their own meteorolo­ gists on staff.Action Item DW1 For you to begin your research, you must first learn how to find, interpret, and describe weather data.To begin, find the current weath­ er for your location (or a nearby location).Record the information below, being sure to include the source of your information.What does this information tell you?What images are provided?Do they help you to inter­ pret the data?Why or why not?Describe what you see.Provide references.
WEATHER VARIABLE CURRENT VALUE SOURCE OF INFORMATION/IMAGES Temperature Air pressure Wind direction Wind speed Sky cover Relative humidity Precipitation Other conditions Action Item DW2 Select some locations around the world where you might schedule your “Global Awareness Tour ” and describe the present weather in those areas. (As a guide to what to look for, use the weather variable list from Action Item DW1.) Write this information on a “post-it ” note or index card, then place it on the world map with a push pin or flag.What is the source of your information?What did you find out?Why did you select these locations?4 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER DAILY WEATHER—EXTREME WEATHER Now it’s time to choose some potential sites for your “Global Awareness Tour.” For the start of the concert tour, you might want to choose locations that have great weather.
Action Item DW3 Using the knowledge you have gained in your research and information from the NASA TRMM satellite, identify three possible locations that would have the fine weather conditions you ’d like for your concert. Be sure to provide supporting informa­ tion for your selection.LOCATION REASON IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE TOUR EXTENSION ACTIVITIES 3.“Think about ….” 1.Learn more about how satellites detect processes What is one question that you thought of during and events on our planet using http://www .noaa.this part of your “Global Awareness Tour ” study that gov/satellites.html.Compare and contrast polar-you might wish to investigate further?What re- orbiting and geostationary satellites.sources do you need to carry out your investigation?2.Compare TRMM data with TOPEX/Poseidon or JASON sea surface observations: http://topex-www .jpl.nasa.gov EXTREME WEATHER “That ’s too much!” Has anyone ever said that to you?Or have you ever said that to someone else?
When it comes to weather, how much is “too much? ” What hap­ pens when there ’s too much or too little rain or snow, very strong winds, or severe conditions?How can TRMM be used to study such extreme weather events?Remember that one of the main purposes of the “Global Awareness Tour ” is to focus attention on how severe weather can have an impact on people.So this is your opportunity to find locations that will demon­strate fascinating aspects of our global environment.Action item EW1 In tr ying to learn as much as you can about world weather patterns, a local meteor­ ologist has provided you with some limited guidance.You have been told that data obtained from the TRMM satellite will be very helpful for your research.However, this is all you ’ve been told.You ’ll need to learn more about this satellite, the type of information it provides, and why it is especially useful to you.The only guidance you’ve received on this satellite is its name.
Where do you go to get information on the satellite? What have you found?Why is this satellite different from others?Remember, you were selected to organize this concert because of your reputation for detail.Computers have been able to put together millions of TRMM observations into one map that shows precipita­ tion over the first five-year period of this satellite ’s oper­ ation.Make sure you include this map in your research: http://trmm.gsfc .nasa.gov/images/5-year_TRMM_ climo.gif 5 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER EXTREME WEATHER Often, extreme weather events in distant parts of the world are related to each other.TRMM can help identify these connections.For example, did you know that flooding in South America and drought in Indonesia and Northern Australia almost always occur when there is an El Ni ño?You can read more about these connec­ tions at: http://trmm.gsfc .nasa.gov/overview_dir/ variability_el_nino.html Drought can occur for several reasons.
In some places, global climatic conditions cause permanent drought.

Raindrops, hailstones, and ice pellets collide with smaller water LIGHTNING U.S. LOCATION SOURCE WORLD LOCATION SOURCE droplets and ice in updrafts and downdrafts.Falling streams create a negative charge that accumulates in the lower parts of clouds, while rising streams create positive charges that accumulate in the upper parts.A lightning discharge neutralizes these differences.Action Item EW8 Use the information you gath­ ered for the chart on p.8 to identify one location in the United States and one location elsewhere in the world where lightning is taking place now.Be sure to include the source of your data.If no storm is taking place now, you can go into the archives to make these selections.On another sheet of paper, write a summary of your observations and conclusions, using the knowledge you have gained from your research.EXTENSION ACTIVITIES 1.Examine TRMM lightning images carefully.Answer the following questions: ● What par ts of the world get a lot of lightning?

How would it feel to be struck by lightning?You can read some survivor stories at: http://www .science.nasa.gov/newhome/ headlines/essd18jun99_1.htm 10 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER EXTREME WEATHER THUNDER MATH EXTENSION ACTIVITY You probably already know that you see lightning before you hear its thunder because light travels faster than sound.You may also know that you can tell how far away you are from the lightning by using a simple “rule of thumb ”: If you count how many seconds it takes to hear thunder after you see a lightning stroke, every five seconds equals a distance of one mile (or 1.6 kilometers).
So, for example, if you see lightning and then count ten seconds before you hear the thun­ der, then the lightning was two miles (3.2 kilometers) away (ten divided by five.) Here ’s a simple math activi­ ty to understand more about this: During a storm, six students at locations A, B, C, D, E, and F saw the lightning stroke at point L at the same moment. The scale on this map is: one centimeter equals one mile.As mentioned above, every five-sec-ond difference between when you see lightning and when you hear thunder means a distance of one mile (or 1.6 kilometers) between you and the storm.Use this information to answer the following questions.A ● C ● SCALE: 1 centimeter = 1 mile (or 1.6 kilometers) 1.Which student heard the thunder first?_______ How long after seeing the lightning?____________ seconds.2.Which student heard the thunder last?_______ How long after seeing the lightning?____________ seconds.3.Which two students heard the thunder at the same time?_______ and _______ .4.

Students become active and responsible for their own learning, and the activity is student-centered; the teacher becomes more of a facilitator or guide, monitoring student progress. By using this model, the students gain information through a series of self-directed activities in which the students need to solve a problem.These problems drive the learning process and are designed to help students develop the skills necessary for critical think­ ing and problem solving.Students learn that in the real world, problems, and their solutions, are not always cut and dried, and that there may be different possible answers to the same problem.They also learn that as they continue to gain information, they need to readjust their plan.In other words, they must per­form self-assessment.A PBL lesson starts with a problem posed directly to the students.These problems are poorly structured to reflect real-world situations.
Students (most commonly in small, cooperative groups) are then left to deter­mine what steps need to be taken in order to solve the problem. The teacher does not give the students the information needed prior to the activity.However, the teacher does need to make sure the students have enough prior knowledge to be able to interpret the problem and determine a plan of action.A key component of PBL is constant feedback.While the students are constantly assessing their work, and in turn adjusting their plan, teachers also need to pro­ vide continual, immediate feedback.Without feedback, students may be uncomfortable with this type of activity, because they do not know what is expected of them.Teacher feedback provides reinforcement for student learning.Feedback should be an authentic, performance-based assessment.Students need to continually evaluate their contributions.
Rubrics pro­vide a good guide for both teachers and students, to ensure that the students are continually kept on the right track. Why use PBL?Traditional teaching methods focus on providing students with information and knowledge.The PBL model also adds “real-world ” problem-solving skills to the classroom.It teaches students that there is some­ times more than one possible answer, and that they have to learn how to decide between/among these answers.Students and PBL Students ar e broken up into groups and are pre­ sented with a poorly structured, complex problem.Students should have enough background knowledge to understand the problem, but should not be experts.Any one, specific solution to the problem should not be evident.The students will need to determine what the problem is that they need to solve.Some organiza­tional questions they may ask themselves are: ● What do w e know about this problem?● What do w e need to know?
● How/where do we get the information needed to solve the problem? The next step for the students is to determine a problem statement.From the information given to them in the problem, they should determine what they need to know and then plan a course of action to get the information they need to propose a solution.In implementing this plan, they will have to gather information to help them solve the problem.They will need to be sure that the resources they use are cur­rent, credible, accurate, and unbiased.As information is gathered and interpreted, they then apply their new knowledge, reevaluate what they know, and redeter­mine what they need to know to solve the problem.Once all the information is gathered, interpreted, and discussed, the group works together to propose a final solution.18 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER Appendix D: Problem-Based Learning Benefits of PBL By using the P roblem-Based Learning method, stu­ dents gain more than just knowledge of facts.
They develop critical thinking skills while working in collab­ orative groups to try to solve a problem. In doing this, they learn how to: ● interpret the question/problem, ● develop a problem statement, ● conduct research, reevaluating prior knowledge as new knowledge is gained, ● determine possible solutions, and ● pick the best possible solution based on the inf or­ mation they have gathered.By providing immediate student feedback, the stu­ dents can continually readjust their thinking, correct­ ing any misconceptions or errors before moving on.By using PBL, students become more familiar with “real-world ” problems.They learn that there is not always only one correct answer, and that they need to work together to gather enough information to deter­mine the best solution.The PBL Classroom When using the PBL model of instruc tion, it is best for students to work in small cooperative groups.
The objective of this model is for students to work in a col­ laborative setting where they can learn social and eth­ical skills to determine how to answer the question presented. Students are expected to regulate them­ selves while in these working groups.PBL Assessment As the student groups work together to collect infor­ mation, they will need to constantly assess their own progress and readjust their plan.As they do this, they will need continual, immediate feedback from the teacher.When they become more comfortable with this model, they will learn to rely less on the teacher and become more independent.By providing the stu­dents with the grading rubric, it will serve as a guide to ensure they are on the right track throughout the activity.
19 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER APPENDIX E TRMM Introduction/Instr uments Introduction to the T ropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Rainfall is one of the most important weather and climate variables that determine whether mankind survives, thrives, or perishes. Water is so ubiquitous on planet Earth that we often take it for granted.Too much water results in devastating floods, and the famine caused by too little water (drought) is repsonsible for more human deaths than all other nat­ural disasters combined.Water comprises more than 75 percent of our bodies and as much as 95 percent of some of the foods we eat.Water is essential to life, as it nourishes our cells and removes the waste they generate.Water determines whether plants produce food, or whether they wither from drought or rot from dampness.Water is essential to our homes and factories, to our production of food, fiber, and manufactured goods, and to just about everything else we produce and consume.
Although water covers more than 70 percent of the Earth ’s sur­ face, only about 3 percent is fresh water —and about 75 percent of that is inaccessible because it is locked up in glaciers and icecaps. Another important aspect of rainfall, or any other precipitation, is its role in redistributing the energy the Earth receives from the Sun.Evaporation of water from the Earth ’s surface, condensation of water vapor into cloud droplets or ice particles, precipitation, runoff of the precipitation, and melting of snow and ice consti­ tute what is known as the water cycle, or the hydrolog­ical cycle.Evaporation, the process of changing water from liquid to gas form, absorbs 540 calories of energy per gram of water; while simply raising the tempera­ ture of a gram of water one degree Celsius —without changing its phase — requires only one calorie of energy.
Thus, much of the Sun ’s energy that reaches the Earth ’s surface is used to evaporate water instead of raising the temperature of the surface. The resulting water vapor is carried upward by the atmosphere until it reaches a level where it is cooled to its condensation temperature.Then the water vapor releases the energy (540 calories per gram) it absorbed during the evapo­ ration process.This “latent heat ” release can occur thousands of kilometers from where the latent heat was originally absorbed.Water plays an additional critical role in weather and climate: water vapor, it turns out, is the most abundant and most important greenhouse gas!Greenhouse gases trap some of the energy given off by the Earth ’s surface in the atmosphere.Therefore, the distribution and quantity of water vapor in the atmosphere are important in determining how well the Earth can emit the energy it absorbs from the Sun back into space.Unless the Earth loses as much energy as it receives, it will warm up.
If the Earth loses more energy than it receives, it will cool down. The distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere also affects cloudiness; and clouds play an important role in determining how much solar energy reaches the Earth ’s surface, as well as how much heat can escape to space.Perhaps it is now obvious that water, in all its forms, plays a critical role in determining what we call weath­ er and climate.Our understanding of the complicated interactions involving water is insufficient to permit us to forecast, with much skill, weather beyond several days and climate beyond a few months.Because the occurrence of precipitation is highly variable in both time and space, and almost three-fourths of the Earth ’s surface has no rain gauges because it is covered by the oceans, we have never been able to adequately observe the global distribution of rain.Measurements from rain gauges on islands and satellite images of clouds have led to estimates of global precipitation.
But TRMM—the first satellite to measure precipitation with the accuracy available from a radar in combina­ tion with other remote sensors —represents a break­ through in our ability to monitor precipitation on a global scale. This is already leading to improved fore­casts, as shown on the next page.20 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER Appendix E: TRMM Introduction/Instr uments without TRMM with TRMM Actual Storm Track Hurricane B onnie, August 1998: 5-Day Forecasts vs.Actual Storm Track Impro ved forecasts can save money ($600K –$1M per mile of coast evacuated) and lives by more precisely predicting where the hurricane eye will be located at landfall.Source: Dr.A.Hou, NASA DAO TRMM Instruments TRMM M icrowave Imager (TMI) The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is a passive microwave sensor that detects and images microwave radiation emitted by water droplets, ice particles, and the Earth ’s surface.
TMI detects radiation at five differ­ ent frequencies, which helps to distinguish between rainfall, bodies of water, and land. Data obtained from this instrument is used to quantify the water vapor, cloud water, and rainfall intensity in the atmosphere.Precipitation Radar (PR) The Precipitation Radar (PR), an active sensor, is the first space-based precipitation radar.PR emits radar pulses toward Earth, which are then reflected by pre­ cipitation particles back to the radar.By measuring the strength of the returned pulses, the radar is able to estimate rainfall rates.Among the three main instru­ ments on TRMM, PR is the most innovative.Other instruments similar to TMI and the Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) have operated in space before, but PR is the first radar launched into space for the purpose of measuring rainfall.
Data obtained from this instrument: ● provides three-dimensional storm structures; ● helps t o determine the intensity and three-dimen- sional distribution of rainfall over land and water, which can be used to infer the three-dimensional distribution of latent heat in the atmosphere; ● provides information on storm depth; and ● provides information on the height at which falling snow or ice particles melt into rain. Visible Infrared Scanner (VIRS) The Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) measures radi­ance in five wavelength bands (from visible to infrared) emitted by clouds, water vapor, and the Earth ’s surface.The intensity of radiation from a cloud corresponds with the brightness or temperature of the cloud, which in turn indicates the height of the cloud —brighter (colder) clouds are higher in altitude, and darker (warmer) clouds are lower.In general, high­er clouds are associated with heavier rain.
By compar­ ing VIRS observations with rainfall estimates from TMI and PR, scientists are able to better understand the relationship between cloud height and rainfall rate, and can apply this knowledge to radiation measure­ ments made by other weather satellites. Cloud and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) The Clouds and the Earth ’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) measures the amount of energy rising from the Earth ’s surface, atmosphere, and clouds.Clouds can have both a warming and cooling effect on the Earth, trapping energy emitted by the Earth ’s surface while blocking energy from the Sun.Similarly, water vapor also warms the Earth by trapping outgoing radiation, but also condenses to form clouds that sometimes have a cooling effect.Data from this instrument helps scientists learn more about how the Earth distributes the energy it receives from the Sun, as well as the effects of clouds and water vapor on the overall tem­ perature and energy budget of the Earth.
This informa­ tion will help long-term climate models make more accurate predictions. Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) The Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) is a powerful instrument that can detect and locate cloud-to- ground, cloud-to-cloud, and intra-cloud lightning.The information gained from this instrument is used to classify cloud types and, together with other TRMM instruments, to correlate lightning flash rate with storm properties, including rainfall rate.It ’s also expect­ ed that the information provided from LIS will lead to future advances in lightning detection and forecasting.21 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER APPENDIX G Glossar y active TRMM sensors— A remote-sensing system that transmits its own radiation to detect an object or area for observation and receives the reflected or transmitted radiation.Radar is an example of an active system.1 The TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) is an active sensor.
2 air masses —Large bodies of air, often hundreds or thousands of miles across, containing air of a similar temperature and humidity. Sometimes the differ­ ence between air masses are hardly noticeable, but if colliding air masses have very different tempera­ tures and humidity values, storms can erupt.1 anticyclone (high pressure system) —A high pressure area where winds blow clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the southern hemisphere.1 cold front —The leading edge of an advancing cold air mass that runs under and displaces the warmer air in its path.Generally, with the passage of a cold front, the temperature and humidity decrease, the pressure rises, and the wind shifts (usually from the southwest to the northwest in the northern hemi­ sphere).Precipitation is generally at and/or behind the front, and with a fast-moving system, a squall line may develop ahead of the front.
3 complex (occluded) front —A composite of two fronts formed as a cold front overtakes a warm front. A cold occlusion results when the coldest air is behind the cold front.The cold front undercuts the warm front and, at the Earth ’s surface, coldest air replaces less-cold air.1 cyclones (low pressure systems) —An area of low pressure where winds blow counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere.1 Doppler radar —A radar that determines the velocity of falling precipitation either toward or away from the radar unit by taking into account the Doppler shift (The change in wave frequency that occurs when the emitter or the observer is moving toward or away from the other).
4 GOES satellite (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) —NASA-developed, NOAA-operated series of satellites that: • provide continuous day and night weather observations; • monitor severe weather events such as hurricanes, thunderstorms, and flash floods; • relay environmental data from surface collecting platforms to a processing center; • perform facsimile transmissions of processed weather data to low-cost receiving stations; • monitor the Earth ’s magnetic field, the energetic particle flux in the satellite ’s vicinity, and x-ray emissions from the Sun; • detect distress signals from downed aircraft and ships. 1 See also: http://www .oso.noaa.gov/goes and http://rsd .gsfc.nasa.gov/goes latitude/longitude —Latitude (aka geodetic latitude) is the angle between a perpendicular at a location, and the equitorial plane of the Earth.Longitude is the angular distance from the Greenwich meridian (0°), along the equator.
This can be measured either east or west to the 180th meridian (180 °) or 0 ° to 360° W. 1 passive TRMM sensors— A system, or instrument, that uses only radiation emitted by the object being viewed, or reflected by the object from a source other than the system or instrument.1 The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI), Visible Infrared Radiometer (VIR), Cloud and Earth Radiant Energy Sensor (CERES), and Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) are all passive sensors.2 radar— Acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging.An electronic instrument used to detect distant objects and measure their range by how they scat­ ter or reflect radio energy.Precipitation and clouds are detected by measuring the strength of the elec­ tromagnetic signal reflected back.3 stationary front —A front which is nearly stationary or moves very little.May be known as a quasi-stationary front.3 22 Investigating the Climate System: WEATHER Appendix G: Glossar y TRMM instrumen ts —See Appendix E.
TRMM satellite —Greenhouse gases and global warming continue to be one of the major environ­ mental concerns in the U.S. and around the world.But the scientists still disagree on such big ques­ tions as: how much warming will there be?what phere to the ocean surface where much of it is absorbed and causes the liquid water there to become the gas we call water vapor.The amount of heat required to turn the liquid water into gas is called latent heat of evaporation.It is called latent because it is hidden away in the water vapor mole- other quantities, such as rainfall, might be affected?where will the changes occur?To predict climate changes that might occur due to greenhouse gases, scientist use very sophisticat­ ed computer models.They try to use all the data cules, but can be released later on as the water vapor rises into the atmosphere and condenses back into liquid water droplets in the clouds or falls back to Earth as rain.
In the tropics, huge equatorial cloud clusters and hurricanes involving lots of vio­ they can possibly find to describe climate as it is today —and then they introduce changes into the models, such as the introduction of greenhouse gases, and see what happens.
